    "This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of various aspects of the supply chain for a cosmetics company. It includes visualizations that track product sales, identify transportation patterns, assess manufacturing costs, and analyse defect rates. The dashboard also includes an interactive scatter plot that allows users to drill down into specific product categories to gain deeper insights. This dashboard can be used by managers and consultants to make informed decisions about optimizing the supply chain and improving overall business performance.\n",

    "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project delves into the complexities of supply chain management in the cosmetics industry. By analysing a dataset from a Fashion and Beauty start-up, we aim to illuminate trends and patterns that can drive data-driven decisions to enhance supply chain efficiency and profitability. This endeavour utilizes data visualization techniques, including Bubble charts, Heatmap, Error Bar plot, Box plots, 3D plot, and Scatter plot, to effectively represent the data's nuances. The Dash and Plotly frameworks provide the scaffolding for creating an interactive dashboard that dynamically displays insights based on user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    " The analytics methods employed in this project include descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. These methods enable us to summarize the data, identify relationships between variables, and model these relationships to make predictions. Additionally, the Pandas library serves as a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis, while Dash facilitates the development of interactive web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    " The chosen datasets, namely sales data, inventory data, and transportation data, provide a comprehensive overview of the makeup supply chain. Sales data reflects product movement and revenue generation, inventory data tracks stock levels and availability, and transportation data outlines logistics and shipping routes. By analysing these datasets, we aim to gain insights into customer demand patterns, stock optimization strategies, and efficient transportation routes.\n",
    "\n",
    " The interactive dashboard, with its visualizations and dynamic filtering options, empowers stakeholders to gain immediate insights into the supply chain's performance. This centralized platform fosters informed decision-making, enabling the company to optimize inventory levels, reduce stockouts and overstocking, enhance customer service, and ultimately improve supply chain profitability."

    "## 2. Project Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes use of the dash framework and plotly express library as well as it provides an interactive chart with significant information of the supply chain data. This dash board is designed in accordance to the prescribed principles of effective dashboard design which entails compressed arrangement and incorporation of the applicable visuals that facilitate quick decoding of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monitor Level\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bubble chart shows general trends in products sold over time by product type. The bubble size shows revenues while different colours correspond to the demographic composition of the customers, so that it is possible to immediately evaluate the general level of product sales and preferences of various groups of consumers of the supply chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The heatmap presents the distribution of customers’ orders by transport mode and shows which carriers are in demand for particular client groups. Involves colour coding with warm colours indicating high customer orders, which is helpful information when planning transportations strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyse Level\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stock Levels versus an error bar plot. The impact of stock management on delivery is further explained by Lead Times. These error bars show the degree of variability across the carriers whereas the colour coding reveals the results of some of the measures including stock and lead-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Box plot analyses the costs incurred in manufacturing with reference to shipping carriers and explores the differences in costs experienced between various shippers. Boxplot helps in finding outliers and areas for cost reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drill-to-Detail Level\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The 3D plot showing defect rates, shipping carriers, and manufacturing costs in three dimensions visualizes how these entities interact with one another. Colour coding of the points enables fast assessment of effect of these variables on the end product’s quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Stock levels versus interactive scatter plot. Users can drill down on specific product types and examine the way stock levels relate to revenue generated. The users can discover more about the performance in some product categories like the consumer electronics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The monitor, analyse, drill to detail approach proposed by Wayne Eckerson informs the design of this four-layer dash board to meet the diverse requirements of the users. The decision-making tool for supply chain management will provide users with a means to track general trends across different areas, analyse particular segments, and gain access to low level statistics.\n"

    "The main focus of the project is to enhance the decision-making process within the cosmetics supply chain through the development of a comprehensive and visually informative dashboard. This involves various facets of supply chain management, including inventory optimization, transportation efficiency, cost reduction, and customer satisfaction improvement. The project utilizes Python, Dash, and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into these critical aspects of the cosmetics industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the reflective evaluation blog post 12 on 11 December 2023, Divya Lakshmi Meesala. Refer to blog further details [https://ele.exeter.ac.uk/mod/oublog/viewpost.php?post=34595] discussed key strengths, challenges faced, and lessons learned throughout the project journey.

    "## 5. Review of Analytics Methods Chosen\n",
    "The development of the dashboard employed a combination of analytics methods to extract meaningful insights from the supply chain data:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): \n",
    "Edward Tufte's principle of integrity and honesty in visualizations is essential in the context of exploratory data analysis (EDA), ensuring that data representations accurately convey information without introducing distortions or biases (Tufte, 1983). The provided supply chain dashboard code exemplifies these principles through careful selection and design of visualizations, aligning with the goals of EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "In EDA, contextual understanding is paramount, and visualizations should provide a clear narrative. The Box Plot illustrating manufacturing costs by shipping carriers avoids chart junk—unnecessary embellishments that can distract from the core message (Tufte, 2006). By choosing a clear and concise representation, the code adheres to the principle of maximizing the data-ink ratio, ensuring that the ink used in the visualization effectively communicates valuable information (Tufte, 1983).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Visualization: \n",
    "The dashboard exhibits a thoughtful composition of multiple graphs, each serving a distinct purpose. The inclusion of a Bubble Chart, Heatmap, Error Bar Plot, Box Plot, 3D Plot, and Interactive Scatter Plot contributes to the layering of information. This approach allows users to engage with the data at various levels, starting from high-level monitoring and progressively moving towards more detailed analyses. The hierarchical arrangement of visualizations ensures a structured and intuitive exploration of the supply chain data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the separation of visualizations into distinct graphs within the dashboard is evident. Each graph is designed to address specific facets of the supply chain data, preventing information overload. The clarity in separating visual displays, such as the Bubble Chart and Heatmap for consolidated views, and the Error Bar Plot and Box Plot for detailed insights, facilitates focused interpretation. Clear axes, labels, and consistent styling contribute to the effective separation of information, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Filtering: \n",
    "Using different data filtering techniques, various subsets of data were focused on including specific product types and regional shipping zones for deeper analysis. An additional dimension of separation is introduced through interactive elements, exemplified by the Interactive Scatter Plot and dropdown menu. This feature provides users with a segregated space to perform user-driven detailed analyses based on selected product types. The interactive components contribute to a clear separation of user-driven exploration, enhancing the overall user experience."
